    <h1>Talk</h1>
    <h2>Lyric</h2>
    <p>Call you up on a Tuesday <br>
        Say, "What's up? Babe, it's too late <br>
        Why'd you have to be so complicated?
        Complicated</p>

    <p>'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before <br>
        You looked familiar when I saw you <br>
        We go together like the gum on my shoes<br>
        We make out, we make out when it's too late<br>
        We go out, we go out on a Tuesday</p>

    <p>A crowded place, waiting for you <br>
        Am I lost? Why can't I find you? <br>
        A silhouette that's in my head <br>
        You don't exist, you're my imagination <br>
        You don't exist, you're just a bad decision</p>

    <p>'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before<br>
        You looked familiar when I saw you<br>
        We go together like the gum on my shoes<br>
        We make out, we make out when it's too late<br>
        We go out, we go out on a Tuesday</p>

    <p>'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before<br>
        You looked familiar when I saw you<br>
        We go together like the gum on my shoes<br>
        We make out, we make out when it's too late<br>
        We go out, we go out on a Tuesday</p>
