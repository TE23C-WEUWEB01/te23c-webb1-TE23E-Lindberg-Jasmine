                <h3>How to build a Raspberry Pi cluster </h3>
                <p>Why would you build a physical cluster? Today you can go to Amazon, or Digital Ocean, or any of the
                    other cloud providers, and spin up a virtual machine in seconds. But the cloud is just someone
                    else’s computers: a Raspberry Pi cluster is a low-cost, versatile system you can use for all kinds
                    of clustered-computing related technologies, and you have total control over the machines that
                    constitute it.</p>

                <p>Dealing with hotel Wi-Fi is almost always a pain. Signing into a portal that doesn’t always work
                    properly on every device — your phone, laptop, tablet, e-reader, watch, and more</p>

                <p>Internet advertising can often be a nuisance. It takes up valuable bandwidth. It weighs your browser
                    down with trackers. It reports your data back to untrustworthy third parties.</p>
